# Base Converter (made in Rust)
A simple number base converter (binary, octal, hexa) made in Rust

## Compiling and testing
Already compiled versions will be on [Releases](https://github.com/lucmsilva651/rust-base-converter/releases), but you can compile the code by yourself with ``rustc``.

Just use this command to compile the code:
```shell
rustc \src\main.rs
```
- Note: in Powershell, you will need to add a dot before the path (idk why)

For testing, you will just use
```shell
main <number>
```
where ``<number>`` is the number you want to convert.
